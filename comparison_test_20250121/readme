Comparison test between Seeed studio probe and WTW
- WTW clock adjusted to UTC
  salinity correction deactivated
  FDO check done 99.5%, ok, beacuse in range [98-100%]

- WTW in saturated becker together with probe Aquatroll 600 from Anne Royer
Aquatroll data DO 94.1%, 8.40mg/L 20.93°C
WTW data       DO 107%,  9.52mg/L  20.8°C
Theoric sat              8.95mg/L +/-5% or 0.4mg/L, calculated by Peggy

It looks like the WTW is surestimating the sat versus the other probes but according to Jonathan it may be realistic regarding the
below explanation:

According to Jonathan Flye it is better not to use data straight from the tap because
it is pressurized water so there is pressurized oxygen in it and when it is pourred in the becker, oxygen 
changes phasis from dissolved to gas and sticks to the foils of becker sides.
So to insure zero salinity and avoid gas bubbles, use rested water from the tap, non pressurized water or even better MilliQ water.

Even more to perform data comparison at diffrent levels of saturation, he recommends to 
put a layer on the becker water surface to stop gas exchanges, then fit a gas bubbler in the becker and 
gas azote in it. We may be able to get saturation steps 20%, 50%, 70% to perform sensor comparison at diffrent sat levels.

- operations followed newt:
- DO calibration DONE dry in saturated air vapor: measured 106.5%
- 12:01 logging started in sursaturated water >100%
- Temp: 
20.9°C WTW
20.9°C SSP
20.9°C analogic
no bubbles on foils WTW nor SSP (SEEED STUDIO PROBE)

- 12:05 solution in preparation in a separated becker with approximated qty of sulfite anhydre dissolved for 5 min
- 12:12:30 pourred 0% sat solution in the 100% sat solution present in the becker with the probes
- 12:25:10 0% sat reached after 13 minutes approx 

Data from the seeed probe has been log with computer time and log_to_serial.py python script. However formatting was not correct
and file could be red only with vim that's whay correction with bash script was performed to get the raw data file from
seeed probe converted_seeed_probe.txt
